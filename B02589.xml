         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>CASE</hi> of <hi>John</hi> Viſcount <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> in Relation to the Bill now depending in this Honourable Houſe, for Settling the Eſtate of <hi>Katharine Fitz-Gerald Villiers,</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE ſaid <hi>Katharine</hi> being Married to <hi>Edward Fitz-Gerald Villiers,</hi> Eſq;, Eldeſt Son of <hi>George</hi> late Viſcount <hi>Grandiſon, Anno</hi> 1685. with the ſaid <hi>Edward,</hi> by Fine and Deed ſettled her own Eſtate in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the uſe of the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> for Life, with Remainder to her ſelf for Life, Remainder to her Sons by him ſucceſſively in Tail Male, with a Power in the ſaid Settlement for the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> by his Laſt Will, or other Inſtrument in Writing, to direct Truſtees named in the ſaid Settlement, to raiſe by the ſaid Eſtate any Sum not exceeding Twelve Thouſand Pounds Sterling, for the better Proviſion for the ſaid <hi>Katharine,</hi> and Portions for his Younger Children; purſuant to which the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> by his Laſt Will, <hi>Anno</hi> 1691. did Deviſe that the ſaid Truſtees ſhould raiſe Two Thouſand Pounds apiece for his Younger Son and his Four Daughters, who are ſtill living, and Two Thouſand Pounds for the ſaid <hi>Katharine</hi> his Wife; and ſoon after the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> Died, the ſaid <hi>Katharine</hi> having neither Joynture or Dower of any Eſtate of the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hellen</hi> Counteſs Dowager of <hi>Clanricard,</hi> the Relict and Second Wife of the ſaid <hi>Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>'s Father, having for her Dower enjoyed a third part of the ſaid <hi>Katharine</hi>'s Eſtate ſo ſettled as aforeſaid, the ſaid <hi>Katharine,</hi> for the Benefit of the ſaid now Viſcount <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> and by the Advice and Concurrence of his neareſt Relations by his Father, for 4000 <hi>l.</hi> which ſhe borrowed at 8 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> Intereſt, purchaſed the ſaid Counteſs of <hi>Clanricard</hi>'s Dower, intending the ſurpluſage of the Rents, above the Intereſt-Money, to be a preſent Maintenance for the preſent Viſcount <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> now Sixteen Years of Age, and otherwiſe totally unprovided.</p>
            <p>After which purchaſe made, the Fine, which was the Foundation of the ſaid Settlement made in 1685. was by Writ of Error Reverſed; and thereon the ſaid <hi>Katharine,</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Proviſion for the Lord <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> and other her Children, is contented, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that this Bill paſs, which is no way for her own advantage, but purely that all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be provided for, as was intended by the Settlement in 1685. and their Father's Will, and to prevent all Quarrels hereafter among them concerning the ſame.</p>
            <p>In this Bill there is a full General Saving of the Right of all Perſons whatſoever, other than the ſaid <hi>Katharine</hi> and her Children, who alone are concerned in this Act.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding which, <hi>John Bargiter,</hi> and others, Creditors of the ſaid <hi>Edward Fitz-Gerald Villiers,</hi> endeavour to hinder the paſſing this Bill, unleſs a Clauſe may be added to it, for charging the Eſtate of the ſaid <hi>Katharine</hi> with their Debt due from him, to which that Eſtate is not ſubject, either in Law or Equity. Nor had he any Power whatſoever to Charge the ſame, otherwiſe than for his Wife and Younger Children, but not for the Payment of his Debts. And although it is recited in the Security made by the ſaid <hi>Edward,</hi> for the Debt claimed by the ſaid <hi>Bargiter,</hi> and others, that he had by a Settlement Dated the <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap> Day of <hi>February,</hi> 1685. Power to Charge that Eſtate for Payment of his Debts, yet that miſ-recital could not inlarge his Power; and 'tis plain by that Security, that the Perſon that Lent the Money, rely'd on the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi>'s Bond, and Intereſt of Ten Pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi> and not of Security of the Land; having never ſeen the Deed of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, which was his own fault; and therefore if he was deceived, it was becauſe he would be ſo, and would not look whether in the Settlement there was any ſuch Power.</p>
            <p>The Petitioners were heard by their Council before the Committee, who were fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied there was no reaſon to put them in a better Condition than they would be, if this Bill ſhould not paſs, and to Charge the Eſtate by Act of Parliament with Debts that do not affect it either in Law or Equity.</p>
            <p>In regard therefore ſuch Right as the Petitioner had, is fully Saved to them by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the Act, it is humbly hoped that the ſaid Bill ſhall paſs.</p>
